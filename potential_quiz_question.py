1. Anne complains that defining Recursion functions to use in her programs is a lot of extra work.
She says she can finish her 
    She's wrong about how much work you have 
    1 Eliminate redundant code
    promotes testing
    2 Hide and control and complexity
    hide and control complexity(control function implementation)
    3 Divide work in chunks
    Code will be more efficient

"""
3.    In what way is a recursive design different from top-down design?
The recursive design is different by the functions it uses by using selection statement
The top down design uses a function that has a while loop
4.    The factorial of a positive integer n , fact(n) , is defined recursively as follows:

fact(n) = 1, when n = 1

fact(n) = n * fact(n âˆ’ 1), otherwise

Define a recursive function fact that returns the factorial of a given positive integer.
